                <h5>This website consists of two geography games. First is a city guessing game where you are given the
                    population, spoken language, life expectancy of the country the city is in, and the currency used in
                    the city. You must guess the city you think it is, if correct you will gain a point. Your score will
                    drop to zero and you will have to restart if your guess is incorrect. In the second game you must
                    choose which urban area has a higher population. The goal of both games is to get the longest streak
                    of correct answers that you can.</h5>

                <h5>This project was a lot of fun for me to learn. The beginning of the project was quite
                    difficult because this was my first time using an API. Once I got through the initial struggle of
                    learning how an API works and how actually to get the data I needed the project went a lot smoother.
                    When coming up with my idea for the project I was very inspired by Geoguessr and the idea of
                    guessing where you are in the world. While looking through possible APIs, when I found the Teleport
                    API I kind of knew that it was the one I wanted to use, and helped inspire the idea of using
                    information about a city to guess where you are. As I got farther into my project I began to see
                    more clearly the vision of how I wanted the games to work as well as gaining a better understanding
                    of how users would use the site. For me, the biggest help to this website was being home for
                    Thanksgiving break. While I was home, I was able to hand my website to my parents and friends and
                    simply tell them to use it with no other guidance. This helped me get a better understanding of what
                    worked and what didnâ€™t with my design as well as learning what I needed to add to make the website
                    easier and accessible for everyone. After returning from break, everything became much easier and
                    free-flowing for me. </h5>
